The entity relationship diagram for the drug dispensing system would include the following entities:

Patient (int SSN, string name, string address, int age);

Doctor (int SSN, string name, string specialty, int years of experience);

Pharmaceutical Company (string name,int phone number);

Drug (string trade name, string formula, string pharmaceutical company);

Pharmacy (string name,string address,int phone number);

Prescription (date date, string quantity,string patient, string doctor, string drug);

Contract (date start date,date end date,string text,string  pharmaceutical company,string pharmacy);

Supervisor (string pharmacy,string contract);

The relationships between these entities would be modeled as follows:

Patient --(1:N)-- Prescription --(N:1)-- Doctor
Pharmacy --(1:N)-- Prescription --(N:1)-- Drug
Pharmaceutical Company --(1:N)-- Drug
Pharmaceutical Company --(1:N)-- Contract --(N:1)-- Pharmacy
Supervisor --(N:1)-- Contract --(1:N)-- Pharmacy
Patient --(N:1)-- Doctor
This diagram shows that each patient can have multiple prescriptions, and each prescription is associated with a doctor, a drug, and a pharmacy. Each pharmacy can have multiple contracts with different pharmaceutical companies, and each contract is associated with a supervisor. Each drug is produced by a pharmaceutical company, and each pharmaceutical company can produce multiple drugs. Finally, each patient has a primary doctor, and each doctor can have multiple patients.
